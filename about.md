I am a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the Weizmann Institute of Science under the supervision of Prof. Yaron Lipman. 
My main fields of interest are machine learning, optimization and shape analysis. More specifically I am working on applying deep learning to irregular domains (e.g., graphs, point clouds, and surfaces) and graph/shape matching problems. 
I serve as a reviewer for NeurIPS, ICCV, SIGGRAPH, SIGGRAPH Asia, ACM TOG, JAIR, TVCG and SGP.
